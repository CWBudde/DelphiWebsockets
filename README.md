DelphiWebsockets
================

Websockets and Socket.io for Delphi.

While this project is based on Indy, it is not part of it. Rather it has been developed by André Mussche. 

André is still the official maintainer of this project, which is very promising. However, there are minor tweaks I want to share to make this great library easier to use for starters.
